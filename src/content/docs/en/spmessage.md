The fundamental building block of the Shelter Protocol, `SPMessage`, is composed of three sections: `head`, `message`, and `sig`:

```json
{
  "head": JSON.stringify({
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "previousHEAD": null | "<previousHEAD>",
    "contractID": null | "<contractID>",
    "originatingContractID": null | "<contractID>",
    "op": "<opcode>",
    "manifest": "<manifest-hash>",
    "nonce": "<uuidv4>"
  }),
  "message": JSON.stringify(<op-value>),
  "sig": {
    "type": "<sig/key type>",
    "keyId": "<keyId>",
    "data": "<signature>"
  }
}
```

Wherever hashes appear in the protocol, they are 32-byte [blake2b](https://www.blake2.net/) hashes prefixed using [`multihash`](https://multiformats.io/multihash/) unless otherwise noted.

### Section: `head`

- `version` specifies the Shelter Protocol version being used.
- `previousHEAD` specifies the hash of the previous message in this contract chain, or `null` if this is the first message.
- `contractID` specifies the hash of the first message in the contract chain that this message is being sent to, or `null` if this is the first message.
- `originatingContractID` if this is a message from one contract to another, this field specifies the `contractID` of the contract sending the message, and `null` otherwise.
- `op` is a short string representation of one of the various [opcodes](opcodes) (e.g. `"c"` for [`OP_CONTRACT`](opcodes#op_contract)).
- `manifest` is the [manifest hash](contract-manifest) of the contract code used to interpret this message.
- `nonce` is a [UUIDv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)) unique identifier for this message. Useful for uniquely identifying messages in the case where a message needs to be resent multiple times due to `previousHEAD` conflicts. See [Resending Messages](#resending-messages)

### Section: `message`

This section contains the actual data payload for the `<opcode>` being invoked.

See [ðŸ“š Reference: Opcodes](opcodes) for details.

### Section: `sig`

- `type` specifies a string describing the ciphers used with the key generating this signature. See [`OP_KEY_ADD`](opcodes#op_key_add) for examples.
- `keyId` is the key `id` of the key used to generate this signature. See [`OP_KEY_ADD`](opcodes#op_key_add).
- `data` is the message signature.

Generating the signature:

1. Hash the `head` JSON and the `message` JSON, concatenate these hashes together, and hash a third time:

   ```js
   blake32b(`${blake32b(headJSON)}${blake32b(messageJSON)}`)
   ```

2. Sign the resulting string using `<keyId>` and encode the `<signature>` using base64.

### Resending Messages

Messages are usually identified in a content-addressable way: by the hash of the entire message JSON. That is how they're stored on the server (and optionally, on the client as well).

However, in some situations it might be more useful to identify a message by its `nonce` value. Take, for example, the case where you are sending a message to a chatroom and want to perform an action upon receiving that message back.

In this situation, it's possible that the message will need to be recreated multiple times before it is successfully sent. This happens when another message makes it into the chain before ours, changing the value we need to use for `previousHEAD`. In that case we would resend the message with the same data except for a different `previousHEAD`. If this is done for us by the underlying framework, we may not be able to setup proper event listeners because we won't know what message hash to listen for. Instead, we can setup an event listener that expects a message with the same `nonce` to be sent back to us and handle things from there.
